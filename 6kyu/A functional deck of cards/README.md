### A functional deck of cards....

Build a deck of playing cards by generating 52 strings representing cards. There are no jokers.

Each card string will have the format of:
```
"ace of hearts"
"ace of spades"
"ace of diamonds"
"ace of clubs"

And will consist of the following ranks:

ace two three four five
six seven eight nine ten
jack queen king
```
They do not need to be in order.

Additional constraints for C#:

* You must at least use one Select() in your solution
* Less than 8 lines
