### String Integer Greater-than

You are to write a function, stringIntGreaterThan that must accept arguments, each being the string representation of an positive or negative integer of any length (could contain a thousand digits, or more; also, integers will not have leading zeros).

The function should then return true if the first argument is greater than the second argument, false if not.
