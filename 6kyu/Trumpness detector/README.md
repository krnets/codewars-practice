### Trumpness detector

Create a function to detect the original and unique rhythm typically having a lot of extra vowels.

The index is calculated based on how many vowels are repeated more than once in a row and dividing them by the total number of vowels a petty enemy of America would use.

For example:

    trump_detector("I will build a huge wall") == 0 
    
    trump_detector("HUUUUUGEEEE WAAAAAALL") == 4 
    
    4 extra "U", 3 extra "E" and 
    5 extra "A" on 3 different vowel groups: 
    12/3 make for a score of 4
    
    trump_detector("listen migrants: IIII KIIIDD YOOOUUU NOOOOOOTTT") == 1.56 
    
    14 extra vowels on 9 base ones

Notes: vowels are only the ones in the patriotic group of "aeiou": "y" should go back to Greece if she thinks she can have the same rights of true American vowels; there is always going to be at least a vowel, as silence is the option of coward Kenyan/terrorist presidents and their friends.

Round each result by two decimal digits.
