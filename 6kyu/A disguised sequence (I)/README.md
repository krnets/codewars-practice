### A disguised sequence (I)

Given u<sub>0</sub> = 1, u<sub>1</sub> = 2 and the relation 6u<sub>n</sub>u<sub>n+1</sub> - 5u<sub>n</sub>u<sub>n+2</sub> +u<sub>n+1</sub>u<sub>n+2</sub> = 0 calculate un for any integer n >= 0.

Examples:

Call fcn the function such as fcn(n) = u<sub>n</sub>

fcn(17) -> 131072; fcn(21) -> 2097152

Remark:

You can take two points of view to do this kata:

* the first one purely algorithmic from the definition of un

* the second one - not at all mandatory, but as a complement - is to get a bit your head around and find which sequence is hidden behind un.
