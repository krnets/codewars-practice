### Simple division

In this Kata, you will be given two numbers, a and b, and your task is to determine if the first number a is divisible by all the prime factors of the second number b. 

For example: 

solve(15,12) = False 

because 15 is not divisible by all the prime factors of 12 (which include 2).
