### L3375p34k

#### General Objective

The objective of this Kata is to provide some way to encode a string into its leetspeak version.<br />

#### Specific Instructions

1) The code must contain a Leetspeak class inherited from an Encoder abstract class and containing an encode(String) method returning itself the encoded String.<br /><br />
2) The encode method should return an empty String if a null parameter is passed.<br /><br />
3) If any uppercase character is given, it should be compared also with the dictionary, 'a' gives '4' but 'A' gives also '4'.<br /><br />
4) If any character outside the dictionary is given, it should be output as is.<br />

#### Dictionary to reproduce

The following dictionary has to be used :<br />
```
a -> 4
e -> 3
l -> 1
m -> /^^\
o -> 0
u -> (_)
```
