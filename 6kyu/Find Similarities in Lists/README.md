### Find Similarities in Lists

Develop a method to get two lists of integers and a number n. 

Then it finds any sequence with the length of n that exist in both lists.

For example:
```
List<int> first = new List<int>() { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 };
List<int> second = new List<int>() { 5, 7, 8, 0, 2, 3, 4, 10 };
int n = 3;

The output will be 2,3,4
```
Or for:
```
List<int> first = new List<int>() { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 };
List<int> second = new List<int>() { 5, 7, 8, 0, 2, 3, 4, 10 };
int n = 2;

The output will be 2,3 | 3,4

, separates the item in the sequence for a similarity. (without space)

Another example:
```
List<int> first = new List<int>() { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 };
List<int> second = new List<int>() { 5, 7, 8, 0, 2, 3, 4, 10 };
int n = 3;
