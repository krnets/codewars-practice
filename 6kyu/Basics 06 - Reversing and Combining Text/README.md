### Basics 06: Reversing and Combining Text

Input: String containing different "words" separated by spaces

1. More than one word? Reverse each word and combine first with second, third with fourth and so on...
   (odd number of words => last one stays alone, but has to be reversed too)
2. Start it again until there's only one word without spaces
3. Return your result...

Some easy examples:
```
Input:  "abc def"
Output: "cbafed"

Input:  "abc def ghi 123"
Output: "defabc123ghi"

Input:  "abc def gh34 434ff 55_eri 123 343"
Output: "43hgff434cbafed343ire_55321"
```
