### Valid string

You are given a sequence of valid words and a string. 

Test if the string is made up by one or more words from the array.

#### Task

Test if the string can be entirely formed by concatenating words of the dictionary.

For example:
```csharp
string[] dictionary = ["code", "wars"]; 

string s = "codewars"; // true -> match 'code', 'wars'

string s1 = "codewar"; // false -> match 'code', unmatched 'war'
