### I love big nums and I cannot lie

Write
```csharp
public static string Biggest(int[] nums)
```
that given an array of numbers >= 0, will arrange them such that they form the biggest number.

For example:
```c
Biggest(new [] { 1, 2, 3 }) == "321"
Biggest(new [] { [3, 30, 34, 5, 9 }) == "9534330"
```
The results will be large so make sure to return a string.
