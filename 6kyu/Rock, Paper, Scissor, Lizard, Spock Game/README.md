### Rock, Paper, Scissor, Lizard, Spock Game

To increase the odds of the old fashioned game (Rock, Paper, Scissors) Sam Kass and Karen Bryla reinvented the game with 5 different items instead of 3: Rock, Paper, Scissor, Lizard, Spock. It was later also featured in the sitcom "The Big Bang Theory".

Examples
```
"rock", "spock"       -->  "Player 2 won!"      because Spock vaporizes rock
"scissor", "lizard"   -->  "Player 1 won!"      because scissor decapitates lizard
"scissor", "Scissor"  -->  "Draw!"              because they are the same
"foo", "Bar"          -->  "Oh, Unknown Thing"  because they are not valid
