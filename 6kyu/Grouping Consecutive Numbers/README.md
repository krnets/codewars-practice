### Grouping Consecutive Numbers

Given an array of integers, produce a string of the numbers in ascending order, with runs of consecutive numbers compacted into a "start-end" form, as follows:

{1,2,3,5} should produce an output string of "1-3, 5"

Duplicate numbers should be ignored, so:

{1,2,2,3} should produce an output string of "1-3"

Numbers should be sorted in ascending order, so:

{5,3,4,1,2} should produce an output string of "1-5"
