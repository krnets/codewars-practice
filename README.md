### Tests

JavaScript tests are executed with Quokka.js.

Python tests are run with Wolf for VSCode.

Both extensions are similar in how they provide flycheck functionality.
Code is being evaluated as it is being written, allowing to view output of tests in real-time.

Java tests are standard JUnit that are run manually.
