### 7-segment converter

A 7-segment converter is basically a fancy way of saying a component that turns a number into instructions for a digital clock display.

For this kata, you need to write a function, sevenSegmentNumber(number), that returns the correct binary input for the display.

The display has 7 segments that look like this:
```
 _ 
|_|
| |
 ¯ 
```
Each segment is turned on or off to form a number from 0 to 9. The instruction it takes is in the form of a single binary stream that looks something like this: 1011010. Each bit tells the display if the corresponding segment should be on or off.

The bits for each segment are in the following order, from right to left: (Binary always reads from right to left!)

    Top Horizontal
    Middle Horizontal
    Bottom Horizontal
    Top-Left Vertical
    Top-Right Vertical
    Bottom-Left Vertical
    Bottom-Right Vertical

So the example instruction above, 1011010 would result in the display only showing the middle, top-left, top-right, and bottom-right segments, forming the shape of a 4. That means that, for the number 4, your function should return 90, which has exactly the same binary representation: 1011010.

If you can do this for each of the other 9 digits, you'll pass the test!

(You should also throw an error if the number passed to the function is not valid, and not a single-digit number.)

I have included a helper function, display(input) which will return some HTML for you to log out to the console, which will show you how the given number input would displayed.

Here's each digit, shown as it should be implemented:

Currently the C# tests will only accept thrown Exception objects for errors.
