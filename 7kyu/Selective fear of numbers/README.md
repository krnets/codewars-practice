### Selective fear of numbers

The number I'm afraid of depends on which day of the week it is.

Monday --> 12

Tuesday --> numbers greater than 95

Wednesday --> 34

Thursday --> 0

Friday --> numbers divisible by 2

Saturday --> 56

Sunday --> 666 or -666

Write a function which takes a string (day of the week) and an integer (number to be tested) so it tells the doctor if I'm afraid or not. (return a boolean)
