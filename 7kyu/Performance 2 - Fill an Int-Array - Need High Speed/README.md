### Performance #2 - Fill an Int-Array - Need High Speed

You have to fill an int Array with numbers from 0 to 3999999.

The numbers have to be in ascending order.

But there is a problem. 

You have to do this very quick. 

Besides, the content will be asserted, there is also a time measurement. 

If your code is too slow, your solution is not valid. 

But don't be afraid, the time measurement uses 50 runs and uses the average. 

Also the allowed time will be always calculated on the fly. 

So also when Codewars is slow, you should get an comparable result.
