### By 3, or not by 3? That is the question

A trick I learned in elementary school to determine whether or not a number was divisible by 3 is to add all of the integers in the number together and to divide the resulting sum by 3. 

If there is no remainder from dividing the sum by 3, then the original number is divisible by 3 as well.

Given a series of digits as a string, determine if the number represented by the string is divisible by 3.

You can expect all test case arguments to be strings representing values greater than 0.

Example:
```
"123"      -> true
"8409"     -> true
"100853"   -> false
"33333333" -> true
"7"        -> false
```
Try to avoid using the % (modulo) operator.
