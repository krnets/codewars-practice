### Musical Transposer - Chromatic

One afternoon you are playing music on your MIDI keyboard, when you decide to write a program that will harmonize with your melody. 

For every note you play, the harmony will transpose it a given number of semi-tones. 

For example, if you play the note C, with a transposition of 1, the harmony will play C#. 

If you play the note A, with a transposition of 7, the harmony will play E. 

For this excercise, the transposition will not exceed an octave (12 semi-tones), but if the value is negative, you will have to transpose down. 

To keep things simple, enharmonic spellings will be limited to sharps and naturals.

Possible notes: "C", "C#", "D", "D#", "E", "F", "F#", "G", "G#", "A", "A#", "B", ("C")

Possible transpositions: any integer between -12 and 12 (inclusive)
