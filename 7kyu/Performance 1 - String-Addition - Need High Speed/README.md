### Performance #1 - String-Addition - Need High Speed


The task is very simple: There is a method that returns numbers. Put 150,000 of these numbers in a string and return this string.

The numbers have to be in the same order as the were delivered by the method.

But there is a problem. You have to do this very quick. Besides, the content will be asserted, there is also a time measurement. If your code is too slow, your solution is not valid. But don't be afraid, the time measurement uses 20 runs and uses the average. Also the allowed time will be always calculated on the fly. So also when Code Wars is slow, you should get an comparable result.
