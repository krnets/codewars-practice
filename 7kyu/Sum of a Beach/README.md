### Sum of a Beach

Beaches are filled with sand, water, fish, and sun. 

Given a string, calculate how many times the words "Sand", "Water", "Fish", and "Sun" appear without overlapping (regardless of the case).

Examples
```
SumOfABeach("WAtErSlIde")                    ==>  1
SumOfABeach("GolDeNSanDyWateRyBeaChSuNN")    ==>  3
SumOfABeach("gOfIshsunesunFiSh")             ==>  4
SumOfABeach("cItYTowNcARShoW")               ==>  0
