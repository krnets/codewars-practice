### Months, Weeks, Days, Hours and Minutes

Given a number of minutes, translate it into a readible human timestamp.

For example: 100 minutes equals "1 hour 40 minutes" And: 52874 minutes equals "1 month 1 week 1 day 17 hours 14 minutes"

Given that each month has 28 days.

The largest amount of minutes you'll have to test for is under a year so you'll have to translate it to Months, Weeks, Days, Hours and Minutes.
