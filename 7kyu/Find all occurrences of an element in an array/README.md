### Find all occurrences of an element in an array

Given an array of integers and an integer n, find all occurrences of n in the given array and return another array containing all the index positions of n in the given array.

If n is not in the given array, return an empty array [].

Assume that n and all values in the given array will always be integers.

Example:
```c
Kata.FindAll(new int[] {6, 9, 3, 4, 3, 82, 11}, 3) => new int[] {2, 4}
