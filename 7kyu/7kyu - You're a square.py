# 7kyu - You're a square!

""" A square of squares

You like building blocks. You especially like building blocks that are squares. 
And what you even like more, is to arrange them into a square of square building blocks!

However, sometimes, you can't arrange them into a square. Instead, you end up with an ordinary rectangle! 
Those blasted things! If you just had a way to know, whether you're currently working in vainâ€¦ Wait! 
That's it! You just have to check if your number of building blocks is a perfect square.

Given an integral number, determine if it's a square number:

In mathematics, a square number or perfect square is an integer that is the square of an integer; 
in other words, it is the product of some integer with itself.

The tests will always use some integral number, so don't worry about that in dynamic typed languages.
