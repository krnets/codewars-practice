### Convert an array of strings to array of numbers

Dev gave you an array of numbers from his API response as an array of strings.

You need to cast the whole array to the correct type.

Create the function ToDoubleArray(array)

that takes as a parameter an array of numbers represented as strings and outputs an array of numbers.

ie:["1", "2", "3"] to [1, 2, 3]

Note that you can receive floats as well.
