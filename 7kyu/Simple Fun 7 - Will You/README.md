### Simple Fun #7: Will You? 

<p>Once Mary heard a famous song, and a line from it stuck in her head. That line was "Will you still love me when I'm no longer young and beautiful?". Mary believes that a person is loved if and only if he/she is both young and beautiful, but this is quite a depressing thought, so she wants to put her belief to the test.</p>
<p> Knowing whether a person is young, beautiful and loved, find out if they contradict Mary's belief.</p>
<p> A person contradicts Mary's belief if one of the following statements is true:</p>
<pre><code>they are young and beautiful but not loved;
they are loved but not young or not beautiful.
</code></pre>
<h1 id="example">Example</h1>
<p> For young = true, beautiful = true and loved = true, the output should be <code>false</code>.</p>
<p> Young and beautiful people are loved according to Mary's belief.</p>
<p> For young = true, beautiful = false and loved = true, the output should be <code>true</code>.</p>
<p> Mary doesn't believe that not beautiful people can be loved.</p>
<h1 id="inputoutput">Input/Output</h1>
<ul>
<li><code>[input]</code> boolean <code>young</code></li>
<li><code>[input]</code> boolean <code>beautiful</code></li>
<li><code>[input]</code> boolean <code>loved</code></li>
<li><code>[output]</code> a boolean value</li>
</ul>
<p>  true if the person contradicts Mary's belief, false otherwise.</p>
