### Form The Minimum

Given a list of digits, return the smallest number that could be formed from these digits, using the digits only once (ignore duplicates).

#### Notes:

    Only positive integers will be passed to the function (> 0 ), no negatives or zeros.

#### Examples
```
minValue ({1, 3, 1})  ==> return (13)
(13) is the minimum number could be formed from {1, 3, 1} , Without duplications


minValue({5, 7, 5, 9, 7})  ==> return (579)
(579) is the minimum number could be formed from {5, 7, 5, 9, 7} , Without duplications


minValue({1, 9, 3, 1, 7, 4, 6, 6, 7}) return  ==> (134679)
(134679) is the minimum number could be formed from {1, 9, 3, 1, 7, 4, 6, 6, 7} , Without duplications
